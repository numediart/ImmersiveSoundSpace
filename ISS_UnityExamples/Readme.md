# Unity Examples for Immersive Sound Space

## Requirements
- [Unity](https://store.unity.com/) (Tested with version 2017.4, might work with newer versions)
- [UnityOSC](https://github.com/jorgegarcia/UnityOSC) for OSC Messages reception and parsing (the code is already included in this project)
- (recommended) [Google Resonance Plugin](https://resonance-audio.github.io/resonance-audio/develop/unity/getting-started) for sound spatialization and echo / reflection / attenuation calculation
