# Immersive Sound Space
A bunch of scripts to follow wireless headphones in 3D space (based on HTC Vive trackers) and compute spacialized sound on Unity

The cornerstone of this system is the HTC Tracker Position Sender Script in the Tracking folder. It is written in python and was made possible mainly thanks to [python openvr](https://github.com/cmbruns/pyopenvr) and [python-osc](https://github.com/attwad/python-osc). More instructions for the installation can be found [here](Tracking/README.md).

Some helpful tools to be used alongside this script can be found in this [other repo](https://github.com/numediart/ISS_Utils).

In the UnityScripts folder, you will find... C# scripts for Unity. They are given here for convenience. See the folder [Readme](UnityScripts/README.md) for more information.
